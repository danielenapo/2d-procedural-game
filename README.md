# 2D procedural game
My first attempt developing a procedural simple game, in html/Javascript using p5.js

## Terrain generator
The terrain generator was taken from [this repository](https://github.com/danielenapo/procedual-terrain-generator). 

I tried to use it to generate infinite chunks, like in Minecraft.

The project is unfinished, since I had some performance problems (maybe p5.js isn't the best for this purpose).
